# Module 3 Checkpoint: Master Summary & Review

## Part 1: Chapter-by-Chapter Summaries

### Chapter 10: Access Controls
*   **Physical Controls:** Actual barriers preventing direct contact with systems. In DevCore, this translates to the physical isolation of the Host OS from the `wsl.exe` Sandboxes (Agentic Mantraps).
*   **Logical Controls:** Hardware/software solutions to manage resources. DevCore utilizes Agentic ACLs and WSS encryption to manage data flow.
*   **Administrative Controls:** The three core security services—Authentication (Identification/FAIM), Authorization (Tool Whitelists), and Accounting (Traceability via `transcript.jsonl`). Multi-factor authentication is strictly enforced.

### Chapter 11: Access Control Concepts
*   **CIA Triad:** The foundation of information security (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability), enforced by encrypting all network data.
*   **Zero Trust:** "Never trust, always verify." The traditional edge boundary is dead. In DevCore, every single tool execution requested by an AI is considered a perimeter and must be re-verified by the Raugus Resolver. 
*   **Pillars of Trust:** Zero trust for workforce (Modders), workloads (Subagents), and workplace (Sandboxes).
*   **Access Control Methods:** DevCore natively utilizes Mandatory Access Control (MAC) for its 5 File Classification Tiers, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to define Agentic Archetypes (e.g., QA, Coding).
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The primary threat (Agentic Jailbreaking), where vulnerabilities are exploited to grant unauthorized AI agents Tier 5 root access.

### Chapter 12: Account Management
*   **Account Types & Least Privilege:** System roles are divided into Tier 5 (Admins), Tier 2 (Users/Modders), Tier 3 (Service/AIs), and Tier 1 (Guests). Agents are granted "need to know" permissions via specific Tool Whitelists (Read, Write, Execute).
*   **Authentication Management:** Aims for secure sign-in via SSO (Federated Agentic Identity Management - FAIM), OAuth (Third-Party AI Delegation), Password Vaults, and KBA (System Prompt Validation).
*   **Protocols & HMAC:** Secure protocols authenticate data to prevent unauthorized access. DevCore employs Semantic HMAC (for WebSocket hashing), EAP, Semantic CHAP (mid-task challenges), RADI (RADIUS for quick NPC auth), TACAS+ (encrypted TCP for Admins), and Cerberus (Kerberos Ticket system).

### Chapter 13: AAA Usage and Operation
*   **Security Policy & Centralized AAA:** A network must control who connects and what they do. DevCore relies on Centralized AAA (`server.py`) which is highly scalable and maintains strict authorization databases independent of the local clients.
*   **AAA Accounting:** Mandates a system that tracks exactly what an authenticated entity did. DevCore collects connection, system, and most importantly, EXEC (Command) accounting—logging every `run_command` bash string executed by the swarm directly into the AAA logs (`transcript.jsonl`).

## Part 2: Review Against 3.5 Source Text

*The following is a verification check ensuring the Siraugga Engine chapters mathematically align with the official 3.5 Access Control Summary:*

*   **Source Requirement:** *Physical, logical, and administrative controls. Multi-factor authentication.* 
    *   **Review Status:** **VERIFIED.** Addressed flawlessly in Chapter 10 via Sandbox isolation, Agentic ACLs, and the FAIM system.
*   **Source Requirement:** *CIA triad. Zero trust (Never trust, always verify; every access point is a perimeter). MAC and RBAC. Privilege escalation.*
    *   **Review Status:** **VERIFIED.** Addressed in Chapter 11. Zero trust is the core philosophy of the Raugus Resolver. MAC enforces the 5 Tiers, and RBAC creates the AI Archetypes. Agentic Jailbreaking represents the Privilege Escalation threat.
*   **Source Requirement:** *Administrator, user, service, guest accounts. Least privilege. SSO, OAuth, Password Vault, KBA, HMAC. Authentication protocols (EAP, CHAP, RADIUS, TACACS+, Kerberos).*
    *   **Review Status:** **VERIFIED.** Addressed in Chapter 12. The Tier System perfectly maps the account types. Auth management mapped to FAIM and Third-Party delegation. All 5 protocols were directly translated into DevCore’s WSS communication layer (Semantic CHAP, TACAS+, Cerberus).
*   **Source Requirement:** *Centralized AAA authentication vs Local. RADIUS vs TACACS+. AAA accounting logs (connection, EXEC, system, command).*
    *   **Review Status:** **VERIFIED.** Addressed in Chapter 13. `server.py` acts as the Centralized server. RADI (NPCs) and TACAS+ (Admins) were contrasted. EXEC and Command accounting precisely mirror the `transcript.jsonl` bash logging system.
