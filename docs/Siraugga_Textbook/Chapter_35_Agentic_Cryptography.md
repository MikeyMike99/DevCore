# Chapter 35: Introduction to Agentic Cryptography

## 35.1 The Vulnerability of a Thought

In the Siraugga Engine, a Subagent's "thought" is simply a massive string of JSON tokens. When a Modder prompts the Swarm to generate a new level for their game, that prompt, along with the AI's entire conversational history, must travel from the Modder's local device, across the internet, into the Orchestrator, and out to a remote LLM API.

If this data travels in plaintext, it is entirely vulnerable. A hacker intercepting the WebSocket connection could steal proprietary game code, or worse, inject a malicious command into the data stream (Prompt Injection) before it reaches the AI.

To secure data as it travels across these links, Tier 5 Admins rely on **Agentic Cryptography**. 

## 35.2 The Computational Trade-off

Cryptography is the science of scrambling data to maintain its confidentiality and integrity. While it is an absolute necessity in decentralized Swarm Hosting, it comes with a severe cost: **Latency**.

Every microsecond the Orchestrator spends encrypting and decrypting an AI's thought is a microsecond the AI is not generating code. In a massive Swarm where millions of tokens are generated every minute, heavy cryptographic algorithms can bottleneck the entire engine. A successful Tier 5 Admin must understand exactly which cryptographic techniques to apply to secure the data without suffocating the Swarm's performance.

## 35.3 Module Objectives & Master Syllabus

This module dives deeply into the mechanics of Agentic Cryptography, transitioning from high-level Swarm theory into the mathematical tools used to lock down the engine.

The master syllabus translates standard cryptography into the following DevCore phases:

1.  **Context Confidentiality:** Determining which encryption algorithm (AES vs RSA) to use based on the speed and security requirements of the AI payload.
2.  **Obscuring Thought Vectors:** Using non-cryptographic techniques (like Base64 encoding or semantic camouflage) to obscure raw data.
3.  **Prompt Integrity and Authenticity:** Understanding how cryptography proves that a JSON prompt was sent by a trusted Modder and hasn't been altered mid-transit.
4.  **Semantic Hashing:** Using mathematical hashing tools to verify the integrity of physical files and `transcript.jsonl` logs.
5.  **Public Key Cryptography:** Implementing Digital Signatures so the Orchestrator can mathematically prove a Python tool is authorized to run.
6.  **The Modder Trust System (PKI):** Utilizing Certificate Authorities and the PKI Trust System to detect if a WebSocket connection is being intercepted by a Man-in-the-Middle attack.
7.  **Impacts on the Swarm:** Exploring how heavy cryptographic overhead directly impacts the speed and efficiency of the Orchestrator's cybersecurity operations.
