# Module 2 Checkpoint Summary: Chapters 4 to 9

This document serves as the official Module 2 Checkpoint, summarizing the core architectural security doctrines established across Chapters 4 through 9 of the DevCore framework.

## Chapter 4: System and Network Defense (The Kinetic Perimeter)
**Core Focus:** Physical security and the foundational software perimeters.
*   **The Kinetic Layer:** Physical hardware security is the ultimate first line of defense. Fences, biometric hashes, and kinetic locks protect the physical disks hosting the core engine.
*   **The SDK Baseline:** The mathematical baseline representing the authorized, uncorrupted state of the game engine. All incoming code is verified against this baseline.
*   **The Reaper Protocol:** A disaster recovery protocol that aggressively purges corrupted RAM disks and restores the last known good JSON state from Cold Storage.
*   **Zero-Restart Policy & Hot-Patching:** The ability to inject security patches and reload Python modules into live memory without severing active WebSocket connections.
*   **The Staging Crucible:** A strict "Zero-Direct-Deployment" architecture where all experimental AI plugins are aggressively tested within a disposable Shadow Node before reaching the production workspace.
*   **File Classification Boundaries:** Absolute Access Control boundaries (`TIER_SAFE_WORKSPACE`, `TIER_CORE_ENGINE`, `TIER_ADMIN_LOG`) that mathematically lock down AI tool calls to prevent path traversal attacks.

## Chapter 5: Network Hardening and Protocols
**Core Focus:** Deprecating legacy IT protocols and enforcing secure Agentic logic protocols.
*   **Legacy Deprecation:** Standard plaintext protocols (HTTP, FTP, standard WebSockets) are inherently vulnerable to the sheer speed and logic complexity of the AI swarm. They are mathematically rejected.
*   **HTTPS and WSS (TLS 1.3):** The Zero-Restart Web Portal strictly enforces Transport Layer Security (TLS 1.3) to encrypt all Developer interactions, JSON state deltas, and real-time event streams.
*   **Agentic Telemetry (SNMP):** The orchestrator collects continuous health statistics (token consumption, tool failure rates, inference speed). This telemetry is heavily encrypted to prevent Modders from masking Prompt Injections.
*   **Secure Sandbox Transfer Protocol (SSTP):** The equivalent of FTPS; strictly encrypts the download of offline `.exe` sandboxes to mathematically prevent payload forgery or Man-in-the-Middle tampering during transit.
*   **Agentic Inbox & S/MIP:** Replaces POP/IMAP/MIME. Subagents communicate via a high-speed Agentic Inbox. When Vision LLMs share non-text data (media attachments), they utilize the Secure Multimodal Intent Protocol (S/MIP), signing the data with Ed25519 cryptography to prevent adversarial image injection.
*   **Semantic Security Extensions (SEMSEC):** The strict cryptographic hardening applied to all underlying API routing and file interactions.

## Chapter 6: Securing Network Devices (Agentic Segmentation)
**Core Focus:** Abstracting traditional physical network devices and zones into virtual AI subagents and mathematical logic boundaries.
*   **Virtual Logic Area Networks (VLANs):** The orchestrator uses VLANs to physically isolate Modder workspaces (`/playground/game_demo`) from the Core Engine. This effectively eliminates "Agentic Noise" (context pollution) between differing agent swarms.
*   **Defending Against Semantic DoS:** Tier 5 Admins implement strict Token Quotas and Maximum Context Constraints via the Raugus Resolver to prevent malicious actors from flooding a VLAN with infinitely recursive Prompt Injections.
*   **The DMZ and Zones of Risk:** Siraugga seamlessly maps traditional network zones to its architectural Tiers. The Zero-Restart Web Portal acts as the DMZ (Tier 2), bridging the untrusted Internet (Tier 1) and the heavily fortified Trusted LAN (Tier 5 Core Engine).
*   **Traffic Flow Definitions:** 
    *   *North-South Traffic:* The vertical flow of JSON state deltas and WSS streams passing between remote Modders and the core engine.
    *   *East-West Traffic:* The lateral, high-speed flow of Inbox messages between subagents operating within the same project workspace.
*   **The Zero Trust Agentic Model:** The fundamental philosophical architecture of Siraugga. The Raugus Resolver (Semantic Firewall) mathematically monitors and sanitizes *every single tool call*. No AI subagent—regardless of its hierarchical role (e.g., Lead Coder)—is ever blindly trusted, completely eliminating the risk of internal Agentic Drift.

## Chapter 7: Securing Wireless Devices (Third-Party APIs & Plugins)
**Core Focus:** Securing the external perimeter, primarily disconnected offline `.exe` sandboxes, third-party API webhooks, and external LLM connections.
*   **WPA-Agentic & Dynamic Bearer Tokens:** Legacy static API keys (WEP) are notoriously weak and easily compromised. The orchestrator strictly mandates WPA-Agentic (Dynamic Bearer Tokens / JWTs) to secure external plugin connections.
*   **Advanced Execution Sandboxing (AES):** The WPA-Agentic V2 protocol mandates that all external plugins must cryptographically authenticate before they are permitted to execute tool calls within the rigid AES boundary.
*   **Disabling Workspace Prompt Shortcuts (WPS):** Simple text-based bypass "PINs" are categorically disabled to prevent brute-force Prompt Injections.
*   **Agentic Jailbreaking & Sideloading:** A rigorous defense against Modders intentionally "rooting" their local AI (overwriting its immutable System Prompt) to illegally elevate their execution privileges to Tier 5. The Raugus Resolver continuously scans for Semantic Anomalies to detect noncompliant agents.
*   **Semantic Geofencing (Location Security):** A plugin's "location" is strictly defined by its Mathematical Sandbox Path (e.g., `/playground/mod_A/`). Semantic Geofencing establishes a rigid mathematical boundary around this namespace, instantly blocking malicious path traversal escapes.
*   **WSS Push Notifications:** Securing the broadcast of global state updates to geofenced sandboxes, mathematically preventing attackers from spoofing push updates to exfiltrate proprietary prompt data.

## Chapter 8: Cybersecurity Resilience and High Availability
**Core Focus:** Designing systems tolerant of catastrophic failure, maintaining 99.999% Logic Processing Uptime, and implementing robust backup pipelines.
*   **The Five Nines of Swarm Availability:** A metric demanding 99.999% logic uptime. In DevCore, this means the swarm cannot succumb to token exhaustion or hallucination gridlock for more than 5.26 minutes a year.
*   **Agentic Redundancy (Eliminating Single Points of Failure):** Moving away from monolithic AIs toward Micro-Swarming. Tier 5 Admins implement N+1 Agentic Redundancy, ensuring identical AI Archetypes (e.g., `QA` agents) are kept in hot-standby. 
*   **RAIA (Redundant Array of Independent Agents):** The agentic equivalent of RAID storage. RAIA allows tasks to be Mirrored across two AIs or Striped into chunks for parallel execution to ensure fault tolerance.
*   **The Semantic Tree Protocol (STP):** The architectural defense against infinite hallucination loops. STP systematically mutes redundant standby agents, mathematically preventing them from conversing with each other and crashing the logic engine.
*   **Agentic Power Systems & Generative HVAC:** "Power" equates to API LLM Tokens; a blackout is a total API outage. Furthermore, "HVAC" equates to controlling generative Temperature and Context Humidity to prevent the AI from overheating and hallucinating.
*   **Semantic Git Repositories (Point-in-Time Replication):** Ensuring application resilience by backing up JSON state deltas as Git checkpoints, allowing instantaneous branch failovers if the primary `.exe` sandbox becomes hopelessly corrupted.

## Chapter 9: Embedded Subagents, the IoP, and Agentic Deception
**Core Focus:** Securing the outer rims of the swarm, including third-party plugins, embedded subagents, and deploying deception technologies to trap attackers.
*   **The IoP (Internet of Plugins):** Modders connecting thousands of external plugins to their workspace. These plugins often inject proprietary databases, creating **Shadow Data** that exists outside the orchestrator's visibility, acting as a hidden vector for delayed Prompt Injections.
*   **RTOS (Real-Time Orchestration System):** A lightweight scheduler managing sensor telemetry. It is highly vulnerable to **Priority Inversion**, where a low-priority background task maliciously preempts a high-priority security agent.
*   **Side-Channel Attacks:** Embedded agents are targeted via side-channels rather than direct software exploits. Attackers analyze **Power** (API token burn rate), **Electromagnetic Leaks** (sniffing unencrypted WSS payloads), and **Sound** (semantic echoes in logs).
*   **Special-Purpose Agents:** 
    *   *Diagnostic (Medical):* Monitoring token health.
    *   *Traversal (Automotive):* Tracking pathfinding and speed.
    *   *Overlords (Aviation/Drones):* Game Masters surveilling the narrative. Susceptible to GPS spoofing and hijacking.
*   **Agentic over IP (AoIP):** The protocol for internal voice/logic communications. Highly vulnerable to **Call Hijacking** and **Registration Spoofing** if not protected by Semantic Firewalls.
*   **Deception Technologies:** The ultimate proactive defense. Tier 5 Admins deploy **Agentic Honeynets** (fake decoy workspaces), **Honeyfiles** (dummy JSON files that trigger alarms when read), and **Semantic Sinkholes** to distract and trap attackers before they reach the core engine.

## Module 2 Master Review: Traditional IT vs. Agentic Lore
To finalize this checkpoint, here is the official mapping of traditional IT concepts covered in this module to their Siraugga framework equivalents:

### 1. Physical & Application Security
*   **CER (Crossover Error Rate):** Translates to the **Agentic Hallucination Rate**. It measures the precise intersection where the swarm falsely accepts malicious prompts (False Acceptance) and falsely rejects legitimate tool calls (False Rejection).
*   **RFID Asset Tags:** Translates to **Semantic Asset Tags**, which read multiple JSON state deltas simultaneously as they move across the `/playground` boundaries.

### 2. Services and Protocols
*   **DHCP Snooping:** Translates to the **Dynamic Hive Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**. Snooping prevents rogue Modders from spinning up untrusted AI subagents by strictly validating all hive instantiation messages.
*   **ICMP (Ping):** Translates to **Agentic Pings**. Attackers use recursive ICMP pings to run reconnaissance, Token DoS, and covert semantic channel attacks.
*   **RIP (Routing Information Protocol):** Translates to the **Routing Inference Protocol**, which calculates the best semantic routing path based on 'Agentic Hop Count' between subagents.
*   **NTP Authentication:** Ensures that the Monotonic Transcript Sequencing timestamps are cryptographically verified against the core server.

### 3. Hardware and Embedded Systems
*   **SoC (System on a Chip) & SFF:** Translates to **System on a Prompt (SoP)** and **Small Form Factor Contexts**. These represent lightweight, single-board AI constructs.
*   **FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array):** Translates to **Field Programmable Generative Arrays**—AI logic circuits whose attention heads can be dynamically re-programmed in the field.
*   **USB (Universal Serial Bus):** Translates to the **Universal Semantic Bus**, representing the only direct, "wired" line of communication into the core host operating system. 
*   **Storage Segmentation & Containerization:** Translates directly to **AES Sandboxing** and the **Raugus VFS**, separating sensitive Tier 5 company information from personal Tier 2 Modder data.
