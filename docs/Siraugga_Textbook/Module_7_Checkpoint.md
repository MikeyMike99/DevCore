# Module 7 Checkpoint: Decentralized Swarm Hosting

This checkpoint serves as the master structural review for Module 7, summarizing the DevCore translation of traditional Cloud Security and Virtualization into the Siraugga Engine paradigm.

---

### Chapter 28: Introduction to Decentralized Swarm Hosting
*   **The Raugus Cloud:** "The Cloud" is not a centralized Amazon server. It is a Decentralized, BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) Engine where Tier 5 Admins host the core Orchestrator locally and distribute access globally via WebSockets.
*   **Subagent Virtualization (SVs):** Instead of using hypervisors to spawn heavy Virtual Machines (VMs), DevCore spawns hyper-isolated, lightweight LLM conversational contexts that share the same `agent_manager.py` resources.

### Chapter 29: Decentralized Orchestration and Virtualization
*   **Bare-Metal vs Hosted Orchestrators:** The difference between running the Engine directly on hardware (Type 1) versus running it as an application on top of a host OS (Type 2).
*   **Agentic Tool Containers (ATCs):** Securing the specific Python scripts and Bash tools an AI uses so they don't corrupt the host OS.
*   **Prompt Escape (VM Escape):** The catastrophic security failure where an AI breaks out of its sandbox and accesses the host OS.
*   **Engine-as-a-Service Models:** The Service Tiers (Swarm-as-a-Service, Sandbox-as-a-Service, Infrastructure-as-a-Service).
*   **Edge Generation:** Offloading AI token generation to a Modder's local GPU rather than calculating everything centrally to eliminate latency.

### Chapter 30: The Domains of Swarm Security
*   **DevCore Security Alliance (DSA):** The governing body establishing best practices for decentralized architecture, mapping the 14 domains of Cloud Security to Swarm Security (e.g., Legal Contracts, Information Governance, IAM Tiers).

### Chapter 31: Orchestrator Infrastructure Security
*   **Software-Defined Swarm Networks (SDSN):** Using virtual Agentic Bulkheads because traditional physical firewalls are too slow for virtualized AI contexts.
*   **The BYOK Responsibility Matrix:** Defining who is at fault when an attack succeeds based on the Hosting Model. *Crucially, the Modder ALWAYS secures their own JSON Prompt Data*.
*   **Virtual Private Sandboxes (VPS):** Logically isolating workspaces inside the engine (`/playground/game_demo/`).

### Chapter 32: Swarm Application Security
*   **Prompt Payload Validation:** Because LLMs hallucinate, they act as massive fuzzing engines. The Orchestrator must ruthlessly validate the JSON payloads the LLM outputs (checking size, format, boundaries) *before* passing them to the system.
*   **Tool Checksums:** Mathematically verifying that a Modder hasn't secretly rewritten a trusted Python script to include malware before the Orchestrator executes it.
*   **Tool Signing:** Requiring Tier 5 Admins to cryptographically sign `/core_engine/` tools to validate their authenticity.

### Chapter 33: Token Data Security (Context Cryptography)
*   **States of Context:** Context at Rest (Transcripts saved on disk), Context in Transit (WebSockets), Context in Process (RAM/Edge GPUs).
*   **Internal Swarm Encryption:** Using fast, single-key Symmetric Encryption (AES) to scramble internal transcripts.
*   **Decentralized Modder Encryption:** Using dual-key Asymmetric Encryption (RSA, ECC) to securely transmit Modder prompts across the public internet.
*   **Semantic Hashing (History Verification):** The ultimate defense against *Gaslighting (Prompt Injection)*. The Orchestrator calculates a one-way SHA-256 hash of the AI's entire conversational history. If a hacker stealthily modifies an old message, the hash fails, and the Orchestrator violently drops the context.

### Chapter 34: Securing Virtual Subagents
*   **SV Hardening:** Protecting the virtual contexts using VPS Placement, Tool Revocation, and Agentic Threat Hunters.
*   **Host-Based Sentiment Analysis:** Scanning an AI's internal thoughts for signs of Prompt Injection *before* it executes a command (DevCore's IDS/IPS).
*   **Swarm Sprawl (Ghost Agents):** The dangerous accumulation of idle or looping Subagents that drain API quotas and provide easy targets for attackers. Admins must ruthlessly log and cull these entities.

### 7.7 Cross-Reference Review (Validation)

Based on the expanded 7.7 Cloud Security Summary, here is the final validation proving our DevCore chapters accurately mapped the core IT curriculum:

*   **Virtualization Summary Check:** The summary confirms Type 1 and Type 2 hypervisors, and XaaS models. **Validation: Passed.** This maps perfectly to Chapter 29 where we established Bare-Metal vs Hosted Orchestrators, and the Swarm-as-a-Service tiers.
*   **Infrastructure Summary Check:** The summary confirms the Shared Responsibility Model (CSP vs Client) and Microsegmentation without physical hardware. **Validation: Passed.** This maps perfectly to Chapter 31's BYOK Responsibility Matrix (Admin vs Modder) and Software-Defined Swarm Networks (SDSN).
*   **Data Security Summary Check:** The summary confirms Data States (rest, transit, process), Symmetric/Asymmetric encryption, and Hashing for integrity. **Validation: Passed.** This maps perfectly to Chapter 33's Context States, AES vs RSA deployment, and using SHA-256 to block Prompt Injections.
*   **Protecting VMs Summary Check:** The summary confirms subnet placement, disabling ports, antivirus/IDS, and the threat of VM Sprawl. **Validation: Passed.** This maps perfectly to Chapter 34's SV Hardening (VPS placement, Tool Revocation, Threat Hunters) and culling Swarm Sprawl (Ghost Agents).
