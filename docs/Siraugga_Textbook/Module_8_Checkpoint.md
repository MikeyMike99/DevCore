# Module 8 Checkpoint: Agentic Cryptography & The Modder Trust System

## Module Overview
Module 8 translated traditional IT Cryptography, Hashing, and PKI into the **Agentic Cryptography** protocols required to secure decentralized Swarm WebSockets. We explored how Tier 5 Admins balance the computational overhead of cryptographic algorithms against the token-generation speed of the Swarm.

## Core Concepts Translated

### 1. Context Confidentiality (Symmetric vs Asymmetric)
*   **Internal Swarm Encryption (AES):** Symmetric encryption. Blazing fast. Used for encrypting bulk AI contexts and `transcript.jsonl` files at rest.
*   **Decentralized Modder Encryption (RSA/ECDSA):** Asymmetric encryption. Very slow, but secure for establishing initial WebSocket connections.
*   **The Diffie-Hellman Handshake:** The mathematical process where the Orchestrator and a remote Modder securely generate a temporary, shared Symmetric Key (AES) over the public internet so they can encrypt massive streams of AI tokens without network lag.

### 2. Obscuring Thought Vectors
*   **Prompt Masking (Data Masking):** Replacing sensitive API keys in transcripts with fake, syntactically correct data (Substitution, Shuffling, Nulling) so Admins can audit AI logic flows safely.
*   **Semantic Steganography:** Hiding a malicious Prompt Injection inside what appears to be harmless text (like an NPC script) to bypass human reviewers.
*   **Multi-Modal Steganography:** Hiding a text-based Prompt Injection inside the pixels of an image so it executes when the AI "looks" at it.

### 3. Context Integrity and Authenticity
*   **Semantic Fingerprinting (Hashing):** Grinding an AI's massive context history down into a fixed 256-bit string (SHA-2 / SHA-3) to mathematically prove (Fixity) it hasn't been altered.
*   **The Token Grinder Analogy:** It is easy to grind a 1,000-word prompt into a hash, but mathematically impossible to reverse the hash back into the original words.
*   **Man-in-the-Swarm Attack:** The fatal flaw of basic hashing where a hacker intercepts the WebSocket, changes the prompt, and recalculates the hash.
*   **Host-Authenticated Swarm Signatures (HMAC):** Defeats the Man-in-the-Swarm attack by mixing a secret encryption key into the hash calculation. 

### 4. Public Key Cryptography & Signatures
*   **Agentic Digital Signatures:** An encrypted hash that proves Identity, Integrity, and Non-Repudiation (legal proof in the audit log that a specific Modder executed a command).
*   **Tool Signing (Code Signing):** The act of a Tier 5 Admin digitally signing a Python script. The Orchestrator strictly refuses to let the AI execute unsigned, untrusted tools.

### 5. The Modder Trust System (PKI)
*   **The Orchestrator (Root CA):** The trusted entity that issues digital certificates (X.509 v3 passports) to Modders.
*   **Tier-Based Certificates:** Traditional Certificate Classes (0-5) map perfectly to DevCore: Class 0/1 for Guests, Class 2/3 for Sandbox Modders, Class 5 for Tier 5 Admins.
*   **Revoking Rogue Modders:** Utilizing CRL (Certificate Revocation Lists) or real-time OCSP to instantly invalidate a Modder's certificate if they go rogue.

### 6. Hash Cracking Defenses
*   **Prompt Rainbow Tables:** Massive, pre-computed lookup tables used by hackers to instantly reverse hashes back into plaintext Modder secrets.
*   **Salting the Swarm (CSPRNG):** Appending a random number to the password *before* hashing it to ensure identical passwords produce entirely different hashes, breaking Rainbow Tables.
*   **Token Stretching:** Deliberately slowing down the Orchestrator's hashing algorithm to cripple attackers trying to brute-force hashes with server farms.

### 7. The Encryption Paradox
*   **Cryptographic Blindspots:** While SSL/TLS WebSockets protect Swarm data from external hackers, they also blind the Tier 5 Cybersecurity Analysts.
*   **Encrypted Prompt Exfiltration:** Hackers utilizing the Orchestrator's own encrypted connections to hide Prompt Injections and steal source code without triggering network-level alarms.
