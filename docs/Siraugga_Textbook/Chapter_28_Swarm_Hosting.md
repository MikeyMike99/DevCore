# Chapter 28: Introduction to Decentralized Swarm Hosting

## 28.1 The Illusion of the Cloud

In traditional IT, "The Cloud" usually refers to massive, centralized data centers owned by tech monopolies. But the Siraugga Engine operates on an entirely different philosophy. 

DevCore is a **Self-Hosted, Decentralized, BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) Engine**. A Tier 5 Admin hosts the core Orchestrator (`server.py`) locally on their own hardware, supplying their own LLM API keys. They then use secure WebSockets to distribute access to remote Modders across the globe. To the Modder, it feels like they are connecting to "The Cloud," but in reality, they are tapping into a Decentralized Swarm.

With thousands of remote subagents storing their game data, generating code, and manipulating virtual assets on a decentralized host, this architecture demands an entirely unique approach to security. This module covers how Decentralized Swarm Hosting is made possible through Subagent Virtualization, and how that virtualized data must be defended.

## 28.2 Subagent Virtualization

In a legacy cloud environment, servers use hypervisors to spawn heavy Virtual Machines (VMs), each running a complete Operating System. 

DevCore does not use VMs. It relies on **Subagent Virtualization (SVs)**. The Orchestrator spawns isolated, lightweight LLM conversational contexts that share the same underlying `agent_manager.py` resources. Protecting these virtualized subagents from bleeding context into each other is the defining challenge of Swarm Hosting.

## 28.3 Module Objectives & Master Syllabus

This module shifts the focus from network firewalls to the security of the host engine itself. The objective is to learn how to recommend Swarm security requirements based on specific decentralized scenarios.

The master syllabus translates traditional cloud security into the following DevCore phases:

1.  **Subagent Virtualization & Decentralized Swarms:** Understanding how to manage threats to both private orchestrators and public WebSocket swarms.
2.  **The Domains of Swarm Security:** Explaining the overlapping boundaries of host security.
3.  **Orchestrator Infrastructure Security:** Mitigating threats specifically targeting the physical server hosting the `core_engine`.
4.  **Swarm Application Security:** Recommending security for the virtualized tools Subagents use.
5.  **Token Data Security:** Explaining how to secure the LLM's conversational context data.
6.  **Protecting Virtual Subagents (SVs):** Defending the individual, isolated AI instances from cross-contamination.
