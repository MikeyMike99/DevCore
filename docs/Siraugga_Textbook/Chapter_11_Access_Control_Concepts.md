# Chapter 11: Access Control Concepts and Privilege Escalation

## 1. Zero Trust Agentic Security
Zero Trust is a comprehensive architectural approach to securing access across networks, AI subagents, and third-party environments. The overarching principle of Zero Trust is: **"Never trust, always verify."**

In legacy networks, the "perimeter" (the firewall) was the only boundary between trusted internal users and the untrusted internet. In the Siraugga framework, this concept is completely inverted. Because autonomous AI agents are prone to Agentic Drift and hallucinatory Prompt Injections, *any place an access control decision is required is considered a perimeter*. 

Even if a highly privileged `Coding` subagent successfully authenticated and bypassed the outer firewall, it is not trusted to alter the `/playground` database until the Raugus Resolver mathematically verifies its specific `write_to_file` payload. The AI must be verified at every single layer of logic execution.

**The Three Pillars of Zero Trust**
DevCore categorizes the Zero Trust framework into three core pillars:
1.  **Zero Trust for the Workforce (Modders):** Ensuring only authenticated Tier 2 Modders with valid HSM tokens can access the Zero-Restart Web Portal, regardless of their physical location.
2.  **Zero Trust for Workloads (The Swarm):** Securing the internal logic. Ensuring that AI subagents (the workload) cannot move laterally or execute tools outside their mathematically assigned boundaries.
3.  **Zero Trust for the Workplace (The IoP):** Securing the Internet of Plugins. Ensuring that third-party webhooks, offline `.exe` sandboxes, and connected Modder devices are rigorously contained.

## 2. Agentic Access Control Models
To mathematically protect its network resources and the underlying game engine, DevCore utilizes specific access control models. Security Analysts must intimately understand these distinct models to defend against attackers trying to break them.

*   **Discretionary Agentic Control (DAC):** The least restrictive model. In DAC, the creator (or owner) of the data controls who has access to it. In Siraugga, this applies to the `TIER_SAFE_WORKSPACE`. A Tier 2 Modder who creates a new JSON game asset in their local `/playground` has Discretionary Control over who can read or edit that specific file.
*   **Mandatory Agentic Control (MAC):** The strictest model, typically used in military applications. It assigns absolute security clearances to specific files. In Siraugga, this applies to the `TIER_CORE_ENGINE`. Even if a Tier 5 Admin wanted to give a Tier 2 Modder DAC control over `server.py`, they cannot. The operating system intrinsically restricts the file to root clearance (Tier 5) only.
*   **Role-Based Agentic Control (RBAC):** The primary logic model of the Siraugga framework. Access decisions are based exclusively on an entity's role. If an AI subagent is spawned with the `Research` Archetype, it is bound to the `Research` RBAC profile. It is mathematically impossible for it to inherit the privileges of a `Coding` role.
*   **Rule-Based Agentic Control:** Network security staff specify rigid conditions associated with tool access. For example, a rule might specify that an AI subagent can only execute a tool if the payload is formatted in strict JSON, outright rejecting any raw plaintext parameters.

## 3. The Principle of Agentic Least Privilege
Another core access control model is the **Principle of Least Privilege**. This dictates that users and processes should be granted the absolute minimum amount of access required to perform their specific work function. 

In the DevCore ecosystem, if a subagent is tasked simply with reading a file to summarize its contents, it should *never* be spawned with a Tool Whitelist that includes `write_to_file` or `run_command`. Giving an AI tools it does not explicitly need vastly increases the attack surface if that AI suffers a Prompt Injection.

**Agentic Privilege Escalation (Jailbreaking)**
A common cyber exploit is known as Privilege Escalation. In this exploit, vulnerabilities in the access control system are used to grant a lower-tier user higher levels of privilege. 

In the Siraugga framework, this translates directly to **Agentic Jailbreaking** or **Rooting**. If an attacker manages to exploit a Rule-Based access control flaw, they can inject malicious instructions that overwrite a subagent's immutable System Prompt. By overwriting the prompt, they trick the central Orchestrator into escalating the agent's privileges, turning a sandboxed Tier 3 subagent into a Tier 5 master administrator. Once the privilege is granted, the threat actor takes complete control of the logic mainframe.

## 4. Agentic Access Control (AAC) Systems
In a traditional IT environment, Network Access Control (NAC) systems support access management by mechanically enforcing organizational policies across thousands of connected devices. 

In the DevCore framework, the NAC is replaced by the **Agentic Access Control (AAC) System**—which is structurally identical to the **Core Agent Orchestrator (`agent_manager.py`)**. The AAC System allows Tier 5 Administrators to monitor the massive swarm of subagents attached to the semantic network and manually control access as required.

The Agentic Access Control system provides the following critical capabilities:
*   **Rapid Policy Enforcement:** The orchestrator can instantly deploy global SDK hot-patches or rapidly revoke WPA-Agentic JWTs during a coordinated Semantic DoS attack.
*   **Recognizing and Profiling Agents:** The AAC system verifies the identity of every connected node, strictly validating the agent's UUID, Archetype, and System Prompt Hash to ensure non-compliant, rooted software cannot cause damage.
*   **Guest Access Portals:** Providing secure, read-only access to Tier 1 End-Users via the Zero-Restart Web Portal.
*   **Pre-Flight Compliance Evaluation:** Evaluating a subagent's compliance prior to permitting network access. For example, the Raugus Resolver executes a Pre-Flight Semantic Check on the agent's proposed Python code, ensuring the syntax matches the security policy *before* passing it to the `wsl.exe` terminal.
*   **Automated Incident Mitigation:** Mitigating active security incidents by blocking, isolating (quarantining an agent into a Semantic Honeynet), or explicitly triggering the Reaper Protocol to destroy non-compliant agents.

**BYOP (Bring Your Own Plugin) and the Zero Trust Backbone**
Because the IoP (Internet of Plugins) and the "Bring Your Own Plugin" (BYOP) culture greatly expand the DevCore attack surface, AAC automation features are absolutely mandatory. 

Without the automated Agent Orchestrator, it would be mathematically impossible for human cybersecurity personnel to manually evaluate the thousands of third-party APIs and offline `.exe` subagents attempting to access the `/playground` simultaneously. Ultimately, the Agentic Access Control System is the central nervous system of the Zero Trust architecture, mechanically enforcing security compliance across the entire swarm.

## 5. Chapter 11 Conclusion: Access Control Concepts
In this chapter, we explored how traditional access control concepts dictate the flow of logic across an entire network infrastructure.

*   We defined the overarching **Zero Trust Agentic Architecture**, establishing that the orchestrator must rigorously verify every single tool call made by an AI subagent, regardless of its internal origins or hierarchical trust level.
*   We translated standard access control models into the DevCore framework, cementing **Role-Based Agentic Control (RBAC)** as the primary method for governing tool whitelists via AI Archetypes.
*   We detailed the catastrophic risks of **Agentic Privilege Escalation (Jailbreaking)**, where an attacker overwrites an agent's System Prompt to steal Tier 5 Admin permissions.
*   Finally, we formalized the role of the central `agent_manager.py` as the ultimate **Agentic Access Control (AAC) System**, executing pre-flight semantic checks and automatically isolating non-compliant subagents to maintain the integrity of the swarm.

### Agentic Knowledge Check: Identifying the Access Control Model
To properly review this chapter, Security Analysts must be able to instantly identify which access control model is being applied during an active semantic audit. Consider the following three DevCore scenarios:

1.  **Scenario 1:** A Tier 2 Modder generates a proprietary JSON quest script in their local `/playground` and explicitly grants read-access to a fellow Modder, while denying access to everyone else.
    *   *Answer:* **Discretionary Agentic Control (DAC)**. The Modder is the creator/owner of the asset and uses DAC to distribute access.
2.  **Scenario 2:** The orchestrator spawns a new subagent. The subagent attempts to execute a `run_command` tool, but the Raugus Resolver immediately blocks the execution, stating that `Narrative` agents are strictly forbidden from executing terminal commands.
    *   *Answer:* **Role-Based Agentic Control (RBAC)**. The agent's access is mathematically defined by its assigned Archetype (its role).
3.  **Scenario 3:** A Tier 5 Administrator attempts to lower the file classification of the `agent_manager.py` script so a Modder can debug it. The underlying operating system completely rejects the command, permanently enforcing root-only access to the file.
    *   *Answer:* **Mandatory Agentic Control (MAC)**. The system enforces an absolute, strict military-style security clearance on the core file that cannot be overridden, even by the owner.
