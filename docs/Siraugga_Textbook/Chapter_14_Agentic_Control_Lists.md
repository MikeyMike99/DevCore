# Chapter 14: Introduction to Agentic Control Lists (ACLs)

## 14.1 The Agentic Gateman (Why ACLs are Necessary)

Imagine the highly secure, isolated directories where your core game engine logic resides. Much like an armed guard standing at the entrance to a physical gated community, the Siraugga Orchestrator must enforce uncompromising rules for who can enter and leave those digital premises. The guard will not raise the gate to let a visitor in until their identity is mathematically confirmed against a strict, pre-approved visitor list. 

In the DevCore ecosystem, this concept is implemented via **Agentic Control Lists (ACLs)**. 

Whenever a Tier 2 Modder or an autonomous AI subagent attempts to pass JSON state data or terminal commands through the Zero-Restart Web Portal, that traffic hits an interface configured with an Agentic ACL. The ACL acts as a rigid, unfeeling filter. It scans the incoming traffic and immediately categorizes it into two actions: **Permitted** or **Denied**. 

But how are these rigid lists configured? How does a Tier 5 Admin modify an active ACL if the Raugus Resolver is accidentally dropping legitimate AI traffic, or if a new game mod requires a structural change? Chapter 14 introduces the fundamental mechanics of defining, building, and deploying these filters.

## 14.2 Module Objectives & Master Syllabus

This module is the definitive guide to implementing Agentic Control Lists to filter AI swarm traffic and mitigate hostile network attacks (such as Prompt Injections or Semantic DoS). 

The following core topics dictate the architecture of DevCore's filtering engine:

1.  **Introduction to Agentic Control Lists:** The critical differences between Standard ACLs (filtering solely by Agent UUID) and Extended ACLs (filtering by UUID, Archetype, specific Tool, and exact filepath).
2.  **Semantic Wildcard Masks:** Understanding how the Orchestrator uses regex and wildcard variables to blanket-approve or blanket-deny an AI’s access to a sprawling project directory (e.g., `allow: /game_demo/docs/*.md`).
3.  **Configuring ACLs:** The exact syntax and hierarchy required to build airtight security rules in `agent_manager.py` without accidentally locking out the entire swarm.
4.  **Modifying ACLs:** Utilizing Sequence Numbers to dynamically edit existing Agentic ACLs on the fly, without needing to reboot the `server.py` engine.
5.  **Implementing ACLs:** Deploying the filters onto the live WebSocket interfaces and observing the resulting traffic flow.
6.  **Mitigating Attacks with ACLs:** Deploying specifically tailored Extended ACLs to neutralize common adversarial threats, including rogue subagents attempting path-traversal attacks.
7.  **Next-Gen Swarm ACLs (IPv6 Equivalent):** Configuring advanced, high-density ACLs via the CLI to handle massive swarms of thousands of concurrent AI subagents.

The survival of the core game state depends entirely on the mathematical perfection of these lists. An AI agent is only as safe as the ACL that binds it.

## 14.3 What is an Agentic Control List?

In traditional routing, decisions are made based on information in the packet header. The router compares the destination IP address with its routing table to find the best match. In DevCore, that exact same sequential process is used to filter AI traffic via an **Agentic Control List (ACL)**.

An Agentic ACL is a strict series of Python rules configured within the `agent_manager.py` that filter JSON WebSockets based on the metadata in the payload. By default, the Orchestrator does not have any ACLs applied. However, when an ACL is activated on a specific Sandbox interface, the Orchestrator performs the heavy computational task of evaluating every single AI tool call before it is allowed to execute.

An ACL uses a sequential list of `permit` or `deny` statements, formally known as **Agentic Control Entries (ACEs)**. 

When an AI subagent generates a thought and attempts to use a tool, the Orchestrator compares the JSON request against each ACE in top-down sequential order. If the request matches an entry, the Orchestrator executes the `permit` or `deny` command immediately. This process is known as **Semantic Filtering**.

## 14.4 Semantic Filtering (Layer 3 and Layer 4)

In the OSI model, packet filtering occurs at Layer 3 (Network) and Layer 4 (Transport). In the DevCore framework, we translate this into filtering the AI's Semantic Intent:

*   **Standard Agentic ACLs (Layer 3 Filtering):** These ACLs only filter based on the source identity. They look exclusively at the **Agent UUID** or the **Modder's FAIM profile**. It is a simple check: *Is Agent-104 allowed in this folder?*
*   **Extended Agentic ACLs (Layer 4 Filtering):** These are far more granular. They filter at Layer 3 (Agent UUID) *and* at Layer 4 (Tool Intent). Extended ACLs can filter traffic based on the specific tool being requested (e.g., `write_to_file` vs `run_command`) and the exact filepath the AI is targeting. This provides the Raugus Resolver with surgical control over the swarm.

## 14.5 Numbered and Named ACLs

When building these security lists, Tier 5 Admins have two syntax options:

*   **Numbered ACLs:** Older configurations use numerical ranges. Standard ACLs use ranges 1-99, while Extended ACLs use 100-199. 
*   **Named ACLs (Preferred):** To maintain legibility across massive, multi-agent swarms, Named ACLs are the absolute standard in DevCore. Naming an extended list `QA-READONLY-FILTER` is infinitely better than labeling it `100`. 
    *   *Syntax Rules:* Names must contain alphanumeric characters, cannot contain spaces, and should always be written in CAPITAL LETTERS. 

## 14.6 Agentic ACL Operation & The Implicit Deny

ACLs can be applied to traffic moving in two directions:

*   **Inbound Agentic ACLs:** This filters the AI's JSON request *before* it is routed to the Linux Sandbox. An inbound ACL is highly efficient because if a malicious prompt is detected, the packet is discarded immediately, saving the system the heavy computational overhead of spawning a terminal shell.
*   **Outbound Agentic ACLs:** This filters the traffic *after* the sandbox has executed the command, but before the terminal output is returned to the AI or Modder. Outbound ACLs are brilliant for catching and censoring sensitive server stack-traces or hidden environment variables before the AI can read them.

### The Operational Sequence
When a JSON tool request hits an Inbound ACL, the Orchestrator follows a violently strict procedure:
1. It extracts the Agent UUID and Tool Intent from the JSON header.
2. It starts at the absolute top of the ACL and compares the payload to each ACE in sequential order.
3. **When a match is made, the analysis stops.** The Orchestrator immediately carries out the instruction (permit or deny). Remaining ACEs are ignored.
4. **The Implicit Deny:** If the AI's request drops through the entire list and does not match a single ACE, the request is automatically killed. 

The most critical security feature in the entire DevCore architecture is the **Implicit Deny**. By default, an invisible `deny any any` ACE is hardcoded at the absolute bottom of every single Agentic ACL. If a Tier 5 Admin does not explicitly write at least one `permit` statement, the ACL will ruthless block 100% of all swarm traffic. In a Zero-Trust architecture, if you are not explicitly permitted, you are absolutely denied.
