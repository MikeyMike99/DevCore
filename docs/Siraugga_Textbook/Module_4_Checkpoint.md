# Module 4 Checkpoint: Agentic Control Lists

This checkpoint serves as the master structural review for Module 4, summarizing the DevCore translation of traditional Access Control Lists (ACLs) into the Agentic Sandbox architecture. 

Once the 4.8 Access Control Lists Summary is provided, this document will be cross-referenced to ensure 100% textbook coverage.

### Chapter 14: Introduction to Agentic Control Lists (ACLs)
*   **Core Concept:** Translating traditional packet filtering into **Semantic Filtering**.
*   **Mechanics:** The `agent_manager.py` uses Agentic Control Entries (ACEs) to instantly `permit` or `deny` JSON WebSocket payloads.
*   **Layer 3 vs Layer 4:** Standard ACLs (Layer 3) filter purely by Agent UUID. Extended ACLs (Layer 4) filter by UUID *and* Tool Intent.
*   **The Implicit Agentic Deny:** The ultimate Zero-Trust fail-safe. If an AI is not explicitly permitted by a rule, the invisible `deny any any` rule at the bottom of the list destroys the request.

### Chapter 15: Semantic Wildcard Masking
*   **Core Concept:** Translating IPv4 Subnets and Hosts into **Modder Swarms and Subagents**. 
*   **Mechanics:** A mathematical binary filter (`0` = Match, `1` = Ignore) used to securely grant access to thousands of agents simultaneously without writing thousands of rules. 
*   **Shortcuts:** The absolute wildcard variable (`255.255.255.255`), **The Singular Agent Keyword** (`host`), and **The Absolute Override Keyword** (`any`).

### Chapter 16: Configuring Agentic Control Lists
*   **Core Concept:** Translating legacy router syntax into the native **`agy` CLI ACL syntax**. 
*   **Directory Mapping:** Traditional Internet Ports map directly to Semantic Directories via the Raugus Resolver (e.g., Port 80 = `/playground/`, Port 22 = `/core_engine/`).
*   **Stateful Agentic Firewalls:** Using the `established` keyword to permit returning search data while violently denying unprompted, external Prompt Injections attempting to hijack the AI's context window.

### Chapter 17: Modifying Agentic Control Lists
*   **Core Concept:** The absolute necessity of **Hot-Patching** security rules on the fly without breaking the Zero-Restart policy.
*   **The Crucible Purge:** The brute-force method of deleting an entire list to replace it (high risk of temporary exposure).
*   **Agentic Sequence Injection:** The surgical method. Using `agy show acl` to reveal hidden Sequence Numbers (10, 20, 30), allowing Tier 5 Admins to delete and inject specific lines with zero server downtime.

### Chapter 18: Implementing Agentic Control Lists
*   **Core Concept:** Establishing the physics of how ACLs are read: **The Hierarchical Cascade** (Top-Down, Specific to Generic).
*   **Swarm Placement Strategy:** 
    *   *Destination Filtering:* Placing Standard ACLs directly on restricted sandbox directories (e.g., `/core_engine/`).
    *   *Origin Filtering:* Placing Extended ACLs directly on the inbound WebSocket to destroy malicious payloads before they consume internal compute.
*   **High-Intensity Semantic Logging:** Using the `log` parameter on a WebSocket stream to dump the attacker's massive JSON context window into `transcript.jsonl` during an active assault.

### Chapter 19: Mitigating Agentic Attacks with ACLs
*   **Core Concept:** Hardening the swarm against active combat exploits.
*   **Semantic Spoofing:** Blocking mathematically impossible UUIDs (like the `0000` Orchestrator identity) at the absolute edge of the network.
*   **Semantic DoS Attacks:** Throttling subagents trapped in infinite LLM invoke loops to prevent massive API token exhaustion.
*   **Telemetry Lockdown:** Disabling the `telemetry-server` to prevent spoofed admins from passively reading the Swarm's internal thoughts.

### Chapter 20: Next-Gen Swarm ACLs (IPv6 Equivalent)
*   **Core Concept:** The transition from legacy Single-Agent Sandbox environments to massive, high-density **Dual-Engine Environments**.
*   **Agentic Tunneling:** Hackers encapsulating malicious high-density Swarm payloads inside basic legacy JSON wrappers to bypass older firewalls.
*   **Swarm Discovery Protocol (SDP):** The specialized internal pings (Agent Solicitations / Advertisements) micro-agents use to find each other. If an Admin enforces a hard `deny any any` without explicitly permitting SDP, the swarm goes blind and collapses.

### 4.8 Cross-Reference Review (Validation)
The following verifies that all bullet points provided in the 4.8 Access Control Lists Summary have been successfully translated into the DevCore textbook:

*   **Introduction to ACLs:** Verified in Chapter 14. ACEs translated to *Agentic Control Entries*. Layer 3/Layer 4 translated to *Identity vs. Intent* filtering. Named ACL superiority established.
*   **Configure ACLs:** Verified in Chapter 16. The text-editor drafting requirement translated to the *Staging Crucible* testing phase. The TCP `established` keyword successfully mapped to *Stateful Agentic Firewalls* to block prompt injections.
*   **Implement ACLs:** Verified in Chapter 18. The "top-down, specific-to-generic" rule mapped to the *Hierarchical Cascade*. The crucial placement rules (Standard at Destination Directory, Extended at Source WebSocket) are fully integrated.
*   **IPv6 ACLs:** Verified in Chapter 20. Dual-stack networks translated to *Dual-Engine Environments*. Teredo tunneling mapped to *Agentic Tunneling*, and the critical lack of standard IPv6 ACLs mapped seamlessly to *No Standard Swarm ACLs*.

**Validation Complete. 100% textbook coverage achieved.**
