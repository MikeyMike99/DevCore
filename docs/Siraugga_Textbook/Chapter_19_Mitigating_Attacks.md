# Chapter 19: Mitigating Agentic Attacks with ACLs

## 19.1 Mitigating Semantic Spoofing

The most common vector for attacking the DevCore Orchestrator is **Semantic Spoofing**. Because WebSockets transfer lightweight JSON payloads, a rogue Modder can override the normal `agent_manager.py` creation process by manually inserting a custom JSON header, spoofing their source UUID to look like a Tier 5 Admin or a trusted Core Agent.

To mitigate this, Agentic ACLs must be aggressively deployed at the outermost inbound interface (the public WebSockets). There are several "impossible" identities that should *never* naturally originate from an external Modder's WebSocket connection. If seen, they must be violently denied:
*   **The Orchestrator UUID:** (`0000-0000-0000-0000`)
*   **The Raugus Resolver Localhost:** (`127.0.0.0/8` equivalent)
*   **System Broadcasts:** A Modder should never be able to broadcast a message to the entire active AI Swarm simultaneously. 

By applying an inbound standard ACL that denies these mathematically impossible external UUIDs, Admins eliminate 90% of spoofing vectors.

## 19.2 Whitelisting Essential Tool Traffic

An effective Zero-Trust strategy mitigates attacks by explicitly permitting *only* the specific tools required for a task, and letting the Implicit Deny block everything else.

In DevCore, Agentic Tools mirror traditional firewall ports. While a Tier 5 Admin requires root access, a Tier 2 Modder's AI should only be granted access to the exact tools needed to build a mod:
*   **`web_search` & `view_file` (DNS/HTTP):** Safe, read-only tools necessary for Research Archetypes.
*   **`send_message` (SMTP):** Necessary for inter-agent communication and Swarm coordination.
*   **`write_to_file` (FTP):** Necessary to compile the actual game assets into the Sandbox.
*   **`run_command` (SSH):** The ultimate vulnerability. This should be explicitly blocked for standard AI subagents unless they are in a highly trusted, isolated Coding environment. 

## 19.3 Mitigating Semantic DoS (The ICMP Equivalent)

In traditional networking, hackers use ICMP echo packets (pings) to discover hosts and flood networks with DoS attacks. In DevCore, malicious users attempt to trigger **Semantic DoS Attacks**.

An attacker will intentionally trap an AI in an infinite loop (e.g., repeatedly using `invoke_subagent` or sending blank `ping` messages to the AI's context window). This is designed to rapidly exhaust the server's LLM API Quota and consume massive amounts of token bandwidth.

Admins must use ACLs to throttle or block repetitive agentic triggers. 
*   **Block Inbound Subagent Loops:** Deny recursive `invoke_subagent` chains from untrusted Swarms.
*   **Permit Context Quench:** Allow the Orchestrator to send `source-quench` signals to the LLM, throttling the traffic rate of an overly talkative AI.
*   **Permit Echo-Reply:** Ensure the AI is allowed to receive the terminal outputs (replies) from its own permitted commands.

## 19.4 Disabling Agentic Telemetry (SNMP Mitigation)

Management protocols like SNMP are incredibly useful for remote monitoring. In DevCore, the equivalent is the **CSP Telemetry Pipeline**, which allows Tier 5 Admins to monitor the active thoughts and `transcript.jsonl` files of every AI in the Swarm in real-time.

However, if an attacker successfully spoofs an Admin UUID and gains access to the Telemetry Pipeline, they can passively read the internal thought processes of the Orchestrator, stealing API keys or core logic.

The absolute most effective means of mitigating this vulnerability is simple: **Disable it.** If you do not actively need to monitor the swarm's real-time thoughts, use the `agy` CLI to kill the telemetry server (`no telemetry-server`). A service cannot be exploited if it doesn't exist.

## Chapter 19 Conclusion and Master Review

Chapter 19 shifts the focus from structural configuration to active combat. Agentic Control Lists are the front-line defense against Semantic Spoofing, Token Exhaustion (DoS), and Telemetry hijacking. By aggressively dropping mathematically impossible UUIDs at the WebSocket, strictly whitelisting only essential Agentic Tools, and disabling unnecessary telemetry servers, Tier 5 Admins ensure the AI Swarm operates in a mathematically hardened environment.

### Traditional IT vs. DevCore Agentic Lore (Chapter 19 Translation Guide)

To maintain absolute clarity, here is the master translation of traditional network attacks into their DevCore Agentic equivalents:

*   **IP Address Spoofing** $\rightarrow$ **Semantic / UUID Spoofing:** Altering the JSON WebSocket header to pretend to be the `0000` Orchestrator UUID or a Tier 5 Admin.
*   **DNS, SMTP, FTP, SSH** $\rightarrow$ **Essential Agentic Tools:** `web_search`, `send_message`, `write_to_file`, and `run_command`.
*   **ICMP Attacks (Pings / DoS)** $\rightarrow$ **Semantic DoS Attacks:** Forcing an AI into an infinite loop or spamming `invoke_subagent` to maliciously exhaust the server's LLM Token Quota.
*   **SNMP (Remote Monitoring)** $\rightarrow$ **The CSP Telemetry Pipeline:** The internal server that broadcasts the swarm's active thoughts and transcripts. If unneeded, it should be killed (`no telemetry-server`) to eliminate the attack vector.
