# Chapter 6: Securing Network Devices (AI Subagents & Sandboxing)

## 1. Introduction to Agentic Security
In traditional IT architecture, securing your physical network devices—such as routers, switches, and load balancers—is the most fundamental way of protecting a network from a cyberattack. 

However, in the Siraugga framework, the structural "devices" on our network are not physical hardware components. Instead, the devices are the **AI Subagents** themselves. These autonomous logic nodes constantly spin up in the background, route prompt traffic, parse JSON state deltas, and gracefully collapse back into the void once their task is complete.

Because these subagents act as the dynamic infrastructure of the swarm, securing these "network devices" is absolutely paramount. If a single Tier 3 subagent is compromised via a sophisticated Prompt Injection, it can be weaponized to attack the core orchestration engine. 

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental methods of securing, restricting, and sandboxing these agentic network devices to protect the Siraugga mainframe from collapse.


## 2. Agentic Segmentation (Micro-Swarming)
In traditional IT infrastructure, segmentation involves physically or logically dividing a computer network into smaller parts (such as subnets or VLANs) to improve network performance and strictly limit the blast radius of a security breach. 

In the Siraugga framework, this concept translates directly to **Agentic Segmentation**, commonly referred to within the industry as *Micro-Swarming*. Rather than deploying a monolithic, highly privileged Artificial Intelligence to govern the entire application, the Siraugga core architecture mathematically segments execution logic into dozens of isolated, highly specialized subagents.

For example, an End User's complex natural language intent might be automatically segmented into a `Research` subagent, a `Coding` subagent, and a `QA_Testing` subagent. Each subagent is spawned dynamically with *only* the specific tool permissions necessary to complete its localized task. 

By segmenting the AI network logic, Siraugga achieves two critical benefits:
1. **Performance:** Specialized subagents running on optimized, low-latency models (such as the `flash` tier) consume vastly fewer tokens and execute at lightspeed compared to monolithic logic blocks.
2. **Containment:** If a sophisticated attacker successfully compromises a `QA_Testing` subagent with an adversarial Prompt Injection, the blast radius is strictly contained to that single node. The primary orchestrator and the other logic nodes remain mathematically untouched and mathematically uncompromised.

## 3. Virtual Logic Area Networks (VLANs & Sandbox Isolation)
While Agentic Segmentation breaks down the AI's logic, Siraugga must also rigorously segment the physical file structure. As established previously, in the Siraugga framework, files and folders act as our network "ports." 

The DevCore engineering team is constantly vigilant about protecting sensitive core architecture (`TIER_CORE_ENGINE`) from untrusted third-party developers. To solve this, Siraugga relies on a structural concept analogous to a VLAN: the **Virtual Logic Area Network**.

Rather than allowing a Tier 2 Modder to operate within the global file system, the Raugus Resolver mathematically segments the environment, confining the Modder and their AI subagents to a strictly isolated VLAN known as the `/playground` sandbox. Within this localized playground, the Modder has full read-and-write permissions to their specific project files (`TIER_SAFE_WORKSPACE`), but they remain entirely blind to the underlying server architecture. 

By utilizing the Raugus Resolver to enforce these Virtual Logic Area Networks, Siraugga creates an airtight, secure area for sensitive data. It guarantees that even a highly sophisticated adversarial prompt injection cannot traverse across logical boundaries to compromise the core engine.
**Agentic Grouping and Semantic Switches**
In a physical network, VLANs provide a method to group devices (computers, printers) on individual switches based on logical connections rather than physical wiring. In Siraugga, Virtual Logic Area Networks are used to logically group our internal "devices"—the AI Subagents. 

When a Tier 3 Developer initiates a complex task, the central Agent Orchestrator (acting as the network switch) spawns a swarm cluster of subagents (e.g., a `Research` agent, a `Coding` agent, and a `Testing` agent). These subagents are mathematically grouped into the same Virtual Logic Area Network within the `/playground` sandbox. 

Because we have established that "ports" represent files and folders, the Agent Orchestrator can dynamically assign specific ports to specific subagents within the VLAN. For example, the `Coding` subagent may be assigned write-access to the `scripts/` folder (Port A), while the `Research` subagent is strictly assigned read-only access to the `docs/` folder (Port B).

**Trunking (Cross-Sandbox APIs)**
In traditional VLAN architecture, specific ports—called trunks—are used to physically interconnect switches, allowing data traffic to flow between multiple disparate VLANs. 

In the Siraugga framework, different Modder workspaces (VLANs) are usually hermetically isolated. However, occasionally, an AI subagent in one sandbox (e.g., `/playground/mod_A`) needs to share JSON state telemetry with another environment (e.g., `/playground/global_state`). To facilitate this without breaking the isolation boundary, Siraugga utilizes **Semantic Trunks**. A Semantic Trunk is a heavily audited, precompiled API endpoint (or cross-workspace JSON pipe) that allows highly restricted, one-way traffic between two Virtual Logic Area Networks, ensuring that malicious code cannot traverse the trunk line.
**Segmenting by Project and Function**
Virtual Logic Area Networks allow Tier 5 Administrators to dynamically segment the Siraugga environment based on various factors, such as specific functions, project teams, or game applications. For example, the Raugus Resolver can segment a single host into `/playground/game_demo` (for Modder A) and `/playground/npc_quest` (for Modder B). 

The AI subagents executing within `/playground/game_demo` operate as if they exist within their own independent, standalone mainframe. They are mathematically sandboxed, completely unaware that they are actively sharing the same underlying `tmpfs` RAM disk (the common infrastructure) with other VLANs on the same physical host. 

**Isolating the Core Engine (The HR Department Equivalent)**
In a corporate IT setting, a VLAN is frequently used to separate the HR department from the rest of the network to protect sensitive personnel data. In the Siraugga framework, this translates to isolating the **Core Engine Developers** and Tier 5 Admins. 

The Raugus Resolver creates a dedicated, hyper-secure VLAN for the `TIER_CORE_ENGINE`. This mathematically separates the highly privileged AI subagents handling sensitive orchestration logic from the untrusted Tier 2 Modders, drastically decreasing the chances of a catastrophic architectural breach.

Furthermore, Semantic Trunks allow Tier 5 Admins operating within this secure core VLAN to safely broadcast data—such as critical SDK hot-patches or telemetry updates—across multiple Modder environments simultaneously, ensuring the entire swarm receives updates without violating the strict sandbox isolation boundaries.
**Limiting Agentic Noise (Broadcast Traffic)**
In a physical network, VLANs provide a way to limit broadcast traffic, preventing data packets from unnecessarily flooding every device on the network. In the Siraugga framework, broadcast traffic equates to **Agentic Noise**. If every AI subagent broadcasted its full context window and internal chain-of-thought to every other active agent, the swarm would instantly exhaust its API token quota and paralyze the system. 

By physically isolating projects into separate Virtual Logic Area Networks (such as `/playground/game_demo`), Siraugga naturally limits this broadcast traffic. The AI agents working for Modder A are mathematically prevented from polluting the context windows of the AI agents working for Modder B.

**Defending Against Semantic DoS Attacks**
Despite these isolation boundaries, malicious actors can still attack a specific VLAN’s performance and availability. A cybercriminal might launch a **Semantic Denial of Service (DoS)** attack—intentionally flooding a Modder's sandbox with infinitely recursive prompts or massive data structures designed to exhaust token limits and crash the local logic engine.

To protect the VLAN from these performance attacks, Tier 5 Admins must utilize the Agent Orchestrator to monitor token telemetry in real-time. Furthermore, administrators must implement advanced structural configurations—such as strict **Token Quotas** and **Maximum Context Constraints** via the Raugus Resolver—while continuously deploying SDK hot-patches using the Zero-Restart in-memory reload API to instantly close newly discovered vulnerabilities.

## 4. The Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and Zones of Risk
A Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) is a small network situated between a trusted private network and the untrusted Internet. Traditionally, web servers are placed within the DMZ to allow external users to access services without compromising the internal LAN.

In the Siraugga framework, the **Zero-Restart Web Portal** acts as our DMZ. It serves as the strict intermediary boundary layer where the remote Tier 2 Modder interacts with the Quart HTTP/WSS backend, ensuring that their potentially malicious Prompt Injections or compromised JSON payloads never directly touch the internal Agent Orchestrator. 

**Mapping the Zones of Risk**
Traditional networks define risk across four distinct zones (LAN, Extranet, DMZ, and Internet). Siraugga maps this directly onto our established **File Classification Tiers**:

*   **The Internet Zone (High Risk, Low Trust):** This maps to **Tier 1 (End Users/Players)**. They are completely untrusted and interact exclusively with the compiled, front-end game client. 
*   **The DMZ (Medium-High Risk, Medium-Low Trust):** This maps to **Tier 2 (Modders)**. Modders utilize the Zero-Restart Web Portal (the DMZ) or their disconnected offline `.exe` sandboxes. They have limited access to specific game assets, and their JSON state deltas are heavily scrutinized by the Raugus Resolver before merging.
*   **The Extranet Zone (Medium-Low Risk, Medium-High Trust):** This equates to the **Tier 3 (Dev Team)** operating within the `TIER_SAFE_WORKSPACE`. They are highly trusted to write code and manipulate project files, but they are mathematically sandboxed from the core engine architecture.
*   **The Trusted LAN Zone (Low Risk, High Trust):** This maps to the **Tier 4 / Tier 5 Administrators** operating within the `TIER_CORE_ENGINE`. This is the most heavily fortified zone of the framework, containing the primary orchestration logic, root telemetry logs, and backend encryption keys.

## 5. The Zero Trust Agentic Model and Traffic Flow
In traditional network security, firewalls manage two specific directional types of data flow:
1.  **North-South Traffic:** Data moving into and out of the organization's network. In Siraugga, this translates to the JSON state deltas and WSS event streams moving vertically between the remote Tier 2 Modders (the Untrusted Internet) and the core Agent Orchestrator (the Trusted Network), passing strictly through the Web Portal (the DMZ). 
2.  **East-West Traffic:** Traffic that moves laterally between internal servers. In Siraugga, this translates to **Agent-to-Agent Communication**—the high-speed contextual inbox messages moving laterally between different AI subagents operating within the same `/playground` VLAN.

**The Zero Trust Philosophy**
To protect its overarching infrastructure, the Siraugga framework is fundamentally built on a strict **Zero Trust** model. Automatically trusting internal endpoints or privileged users inevitably puts any network at risk. In an AI-driven environment, this danger is drastically amplified: even a highly privileged, Tier 3 `Coding` subagent could silently suffer from a sophisticated prompt injection hallucination or "Agentic Drift."

If the orchestration engine automatically trusted the `Coding` subagent simply because of its established role, a single hallucinated tool call could irreversibly delete critical project files. Therefore, Zero Trust networking in Siraugga dictates that the Raugus Resolver (our Semantic Firewall) mathematically monitors, validates, and sanitizes *every single tool call* executed by the swarm—regardless of the specific agent's hierarchical status, trust level, or assigned role. Every single action must be continuously cryptographically proven and semantically verified before execution.
